# Machine Learning in Multimodal Data

This repository consists of .ipynb files, in the scope of the second semester "Machine Learning in Multimodal Data" exersice in Master in AI in NSCR Demokritos.

Overview of the files:

* [Text_Extraction.ipynb](https://github.com/Andreas-Stefopoulos/Machine-Learning-Multimodal/blob/main/Text_Extraction.ipynb) file, where our code is inlcuded. Our task was to create a pipeline of machine learning and image preprocessing algorithms, in order to extract text from images (machine and hand written) and correct it using NLP algorithms.
* [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Andreas-Stefopoulos/Machine-Learning-Multimodal/blob/main/requirements.txt) - A .txt file with all the virtual environment requirements to run the above Jupiter notebook file.
* [Test Images](https://github.com/Andreas-Stefopoulos/Machine-Learning-Multimodal/tree/main/Test%20Images) folder, which includes a few of our testing images.
